  A Tutorial on Schematic Polymorphism in Abella  
</h1>
</center>
</br>
</br>

<p>
The newest release of Abella adds the support
of <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3236950.3236961">schematic
polymorphism</a> without changing its theoretical underpinnings. The
key ideas include the following:

<ul>
  <li> We allow terms, definitions and theorems to be parameterized by
    type variables. Those are called <em>schematic terms, definitions
    and theorems</em>, respectively. They represent their monomorphic
    counterparts under the instantiation of the parameterizing type
    variables with ground types. In other words, they function as
    schemata for generating terms, definitions and theorems in the
    logic of Abella under type instantiation.
  </li> 

  <li> Given a schematic theorem, we restrict our attention to the
    construction of <em>schematic proofs</em> for it. Those are proof
    schemata parameterized by the same type variables parameterizing
    the theorem. By plugging in ground types for the parameterizing
    variables they become actual proofs for the instantiated theorem
    in the logic of Abella. In other words, the schematic proofs are
    ignorant of type information and their structures are stable under
    type instantiation.
  </li>

  <li>
    We apply the same idea to encode and reason about the
    specification logic and polymorphic program clauses. As a result,
    we are now able to prove properties of polymorphic specifications
    in &lambda;-Prolog, as long as schematic proofs for these
    properties can be constructed.
  </li>
</ul>

We present a tutorial of schematic polymorphism in Abella. We assume
that the reader is already familiar with the basics of Abella. If not,
please consult the
comprehensive <a href="http://jfr.unibo.it/article/view/4650">Abella
tutorial</a>. In the subsequent sections, we first exhibit how the
schematic terms, definitions, theorems and proofs work and then
show how to reason about polymorphic programs written in
&lambda;-Prolog. In each section, we discuss the limitations of
schematic polymorphism. All the discussions are driven by small
examples that are (supposedly) easy to understand. The examples can be
found <a href="../examples/schm-poly/schm_poly_tst.html">here</a>.
For more technical details, please
consult <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3236950.3236961">the
accompanying paper</a> and

<div class="section">

<h2 id="basics">
Basics of Schematic Polymorphism
</h2>
</br>


<h3 id="schm-terms">
Schematic terms
</h2>
</br>

<p>
We allow type variables and type constructors that may take types as
arguments in forming type expressions. The type constructor
declaration now has the following form:

<pre>
Kind a   type -> ... -> type.
</pre>

As an example, the type constructor for lists is the following which
takes the type of list elements as an argument:
<pre>
Kind list   type -> type.
</pre>

The type expression <code>list (list int) -> list bool</code>
represents the type of functions from lists of lists of integers to
lists of booleans.
</p>

<p>
We define constructors of terms as follows:
<pre>
Type c   T
</pre>
It declares a <em>schematic constant</em> <code>c</code> whose
type <code>T</code> is parameterized by the free type
variables <code>A1,...,An</code> occurring in <code>T</code>. By
plugging in ground types for <code>A1,...,An</code> in <code>T</code>,
we get a constant <code>c</code> of the instantiated type. Note that
when <code>T</code> does not contain any type variable, a normal
constant <code>c</code> of type <code>T</code> is declared.
</p>

<p>
As an example, the schematic constants for constructing lists are
defined as follows:

<pre>
Type nil  list A.
Type ::   A -> list A -> list A.
</pre>

In fact, Abella has already built in the declarations
of <code>list</code>, <code>nil</code> and <code>::</code>. So we do
not need to explicitly declare them. As usual, <code>::</code> is used
as an infix operator. As an example, the following term is a list of
integers 

<pre>
  1 :: 2 :: 3 :: nil
</pre>

where the parameterizing type variable <code>A</code> of
<code>nil</code> and <code>::</code> are inferred as (instantiated to)
<code>int</code>.
</p>

</br>
<h3 id="schm-defs">
Schematic definitions
</h2>
</br>

<p>
Given schematic terms, we construct schematic definitions
parameterized by type variables. They stand for an infinite
collection of definitions under the instantiation of the
parameterizing type variables with ground types.

As an example, the schematic definition for the append relation is as
follows:
<pre>
Define append : list A -> list A -> list A -> prop by
  append nil L L;
  append (X :: L1) L2 (X :: L3) := append L1 L2 L3.
</pre>

The definition is very much like that of the monomorphic append
relation, except that <code>append</code> is a schematic constant
whose type is parameterized by the type variable <code>A</code>. The
whole definition is also parameterized by <code>A</code>. By
instantiating <code>A</code> with ground types, we get the definitions
of append for lists of these types. In this
definition, <code>append</code> must be used at its most general
type. That is, all the occurrences of <code>append</code> in the
definition must have the type <code>list A -> list A -> list
A</code>. Note here the types of the constants <code>nil</code>
and <code>::</code> are automatically inferred to be <code>list
A</code> and <code>A -> list A -> list A</code> where A is the
parameterizing type variable. Once <code>append</code> is defined, it
can be used at any of its type instances.
</p>

</br>
<h3 id="schm-theorems">
Schematic theorems
</h3>
</br>

<p>
Given schematic definitions, we can state schematic theorems about
them. For example, the following theorem describes
that <code>append</code> is deterministic in its third argument.

<pre>
Theorem append_det[A] : forall (L1: list A) L2 L3 L3',
  append L1 L2 L3 -> append L1 L2 L3' -> L3 = L3'.
</pre>

Note that the list of variables after the name of the theorem contains
the type variables parameterizing the theorem. To help infer the
correct type of the formula, we annotate <code>L1</code> with the
type <code>list A</code>. 

To prove this theorem, we need to show it hold for all the type
instances for <code>A</code>.
</p>


</br>
<h3 id="schm-theorems">
Schematic proofs
</h3>
</br>

<p>
We are only interested in constructing schematic proofs for a
schematic theorem, which are parameterized by the same type variables
of the theorem and, given any ground type instantiation, become actual
proofs of the instantiated theorem by simply replacing the occurrences
of type variables in them with the type instances given by the
instantiation.
</p>

<p>
To construct schematic proofs, Abella ensures that every tactic in its
successful application only employs the so-called <em>schematic proofs
rules</em> to build up the proofs; these are proof rules whose shapes
are stable under type instantiation and that coincide with the proof
rules in the logic of Abella under ground type instantiation. When
schematic proof rules are not applicable, the tactics that implement
them will fail to apply and return an error message; the proof hence
gets stuck. Most of the proof rules in the logic of Abella are
immediately schematic by parameterizing them over type variables. The
only non-trivial case is for the rule of case analysis, which is
implemented by the <code>case</code> tactic. For this rule to be
schematic, a type-generic solution to the unification problem incurred
by case analysis must exist
(see <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3236950.3236961">the paper</a>
for details). Abella finds type-generic unifiers by treating type
variables as "black boxes" during case analysis (unification). It
ensures that if its unification algorithm finds a solution without
inspecting the structures of types for type variables, then the
obtained solution is type-generic.
</p>

<p>
Continuing the example <code>append_det</code>, we observe that it can
be proved by following the same proof by induction on the first
assumption, no matter what type is substituted for <code>A</code>. In
other words, the parameterizing type <code>A</code> is treated as a
black box throughout the proof. Therefore, we guess that a schematic
proof exists for <code>append_det</code>. Indeed, we can type in the
following proof scripts in Abella to finish the proof
for <code>append_det</code>:

<pre>
Theorem append_det[A] : forall (L1: list A) L2 L3 L3',
  append L1 L2 L3 -> append L1 L2 L3' -> L3 = L3'.
induction on 1. intros. case H1.
  case H2. search.
  case H2. apply IH to H3 H4. search.  
</pre>
The key to this proof is that case analyses do not inspect what
type <code>A</code> could be when doing unification. We left the
details of the proof for the readers to explore.
</p>

<p>
We can apply the schematic theorems at specific type instances. For
example, the following special case of <code>append_det</code> at the
type <code>o</code> is proved by applying <code>append_det</code>.

<pre>
Theorem oappend_det : forall (L1: list o) L2 L3 L3',
  append L1 L2 L3 -> append L1 L2 L3' -> L3 = L3'.
intros. apply append_det[o] to H1 H2. search.
</pre>

Here, we explicitly provide the type instances for the parameterizing
type variables of <code>append_det</code> in the <code>apply</code>
tactic. The following is another example, which simply restates and
proves <code>append_det</code>.

<pre>
Theorem append_det1[A] : forall (L1: list A) L2 L3 L3',
  append L1 L2 L3 -> append L1 L2 L3' -> L3 = L3'.
intros. apply append_det[A] to H1 H2. search.
</pre>

When applying schematic theorems, we can omit the instances for their
parameterizing type variables if they can be inferred from the
context, as illustrated by the following examples.

<pre>
Theorem append_det2[A] : forall (L1: list A) L2 L3 L3',
  append L1 L2 L3 -> append L1 L2 L3' -> L3 = L3'.
intros. apply append_det[_] to H1 H2. search.

Theorem append_det3[A] : forall (L1: list A) L2 L3 L3',
  append L1 L2 L3 -> append L1 L2 L3' -> L3 = L3'.
intros. apply append_det to H1 H2. search.
</pre>

<p>

<h3 id="hoas">
Interplay with higher-order abstract syntax
</h3>
</br>

<p>
We have seen how schematic polymorphism allows us to prove common
properties of generic data structures. Another significant benefit is
that it allows us to prove common properties about the structures of
higher-order syntax and to apply them at arbitrary type instances. For
example, given the following membership definition of lists:

<pre>
Define member : A -> list A -> prop by
  member X (X :: L);
  member X (Y :: L) := member X L.
</pre>

we would like to prove that if a list does not depend on a nominal
constant, then any dependency of its element on this nominal constant
is vacuous. By exploiting higher-order abstract syntax, this property
can be stated as the following theorem:

<pre>
Theorem member_prune[A,B] : forall M (L:list A), nabla (x:B),
  member (M x) L -> exists M', M = y\M'.  
</pre>

We note that it has the same proof by induction on the only assumption
which does not inspect the types for <code>A</code>
and <code>B</code>. Therefore, it has a schematic proof, as follows:
<pre>
Theorem member_prune[A,B] : forall M (L:list A), nabla (x:B),
  member (M x) L -> exists M', M = y\M'.
induction on 1. intros. case H1.
  search.
  apply IH to H2. search.
</pre>
Again, the key for getting a schematic proof is that case analysis
(unification) treats <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> as black boxes.
</p>

</p>
We can apply <code>member_prune</code> at specific types
for <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, the following are some
examples:

<pre>
Theorem olist_mem_prune : forall M (L:list o), nabla (x:o),
  member (M x) L -> exists M', M = y\M'.
intros. apply member_prune[o,o] to H1. search.

Theorem member_prune1[A,B] : forall M (L:list A), nabla (x:B),
  member (M x) L -> exists M', M = y\M'.
intros. apply member_prune[A,B] to H1. search.  
</pre>

Again, we can omit some or all type instances when using
the <code>apply</code> tactic, as shown in the following examples:

<pre>
Theorem member_prune2[A,B] : forall M (L:list A), nabla (x:B),
  member (M x) L -> exists M', M = y\M'.
intros. apply member_prune[_,B] to H1. search.

Theorem member_prune3[A,B] : forall M (L:list A), nabla (x:i),
  member (M x) L -> exists M', M = y\M'.
intros. apply member_prune[_,i] to H1. search.

Theorem member_prune4[A,B] : forall M (L:list A), nabla (x:i),
  member (M x) L -> exists M', M = y\M'.
intros. apply member_prune to H1. search.
</pre>

We can use the <code>backchain</code> tactic to achieve similar effects:

<pre>
Theorem olist_mem_prune_bc : forall M (L:list o), nabla (x:o),
  member (M x) L -> exists M', M = y\M'.
intros. backchain member_prune[o,o].

Theorem member_prune1_bc[A,B] : forall M (L:list A), nabla (x:B),
  member (M x) L -> exists M', M = y\M'.
intros. backchain member_prune[A,B].  
</pre>

</p>

Limitations of schematic polymorphism
</h3>
</br>

<p>
It is not always possible to construct proofs schematically. For
example, some schematic theorem may or may not have a proof depending
on the type instances for its parameterizing type variables. As an
example, given the following constant <code>p</code> and a schematic
definition of equality <code>eq</code>:

<pre>
Type p   A -> o.

Define eq : A -> A -> prop by
  eq M M.
</pre>

The following proposition is not provable schematically.

<pre>
Theorem tst [A,B] : forall (X:A) (Y:B),
  eq (p X) (p Y) -> false.
</pre>

This is because its provability depends on whether <code>A</code>
and <code>B</code> are instantiated to the same type:

<ul>
<li>
When <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are different types, the two
occurrences of <code>p</code> represent distinct constants. As such,
the assumption is vacuously false and the proposition is indeed a
theorem.
</li>
<li>
When <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are the same type, the two
occurrences of <code>p</code> represent the same constant. As such,
the assumption is true if <code>X = Y</code>. In this case, the
proposition is not provable.
</li>
</ul>

If we try to prove this proposition in Abella, we get stuck after
applying the following tactics:
<pre>
intros. case H1.
</pre>

in the following proof state with an error message:

<pre>
Error: Unification error during case analysis: 
the generic type variable A cannot be instantiated

Variables: X Y
H1 : eq (p X) (p Y)
============================
 false
</pre>

The error message indicates that unification tries to inspect the
structure of <code>A</code> which should be treated as a black box for
a type-generic unifier to exist. Therefore, case analysis fails to
apply schematically.

<h2 id="specs">
Reasoning about Polymorphic Specifications
</h2>
</br>

<p>
Via schematic polymorphism, we are able to encode a subset of the
logic of &lambda;-Prolog and polymorphic program clauses as a
fixed-point definition in the logic of Abella. Through this encoding,
we are able to reason about polymorphic programs written in
&lambda;-Prolog. This section demonstrates how it is done by walking
through some examples and discusses the limitations of this
approach. The technical details can be found in the accompanying
paper.
</p>

<p>
Suppose we have the following &lambda;-Prolog program which simply
implements the append relation at the specification level.

<pre>
type app   list A -> list A -> list A -> o.

app nil L L.
app (X :: L1) L2 (X :: L3) :- app L1 L2 L3.
</pre>

Here the occurrences of <code>app</code> in every clause have their
most general type. Each clause represents an infinite collection of
clauses obtained by instantiating the free type variables in the
clause (in this example, there is only one free type variable in each
clause).

</p>

<p>
We are able to prove properties about <code>app</code> just as we can
for the simply typed version of it, as long as schematic proofs can be
constructed. For example, the following theorem is easily proved by
using <code>search</code>.

<pre>
Theorem app_search[A] : forall (X:A) L,
  {app (X :: nil) L (X :: L)}.
search.
</pre>

Here, the proof is finished by backchaining on the instances of the
program clauses obtained by instantiating their only free type
variable with the parameterizing variable <code>A</code>.
</p>

<p>
The following is a more complicated example which replays the
deterministic theorem we discussed before for <code>app</code>:

<pre>
Theorem app_det[A] : forall (L1: list A) L2 L3 L3',
  {app L1 L2 L3} -> {app L1 L2 L3'} -> L3 = L3'.
induction on 1. intros. case H1.
  case H2. search.
  case H2. apply IH to H3 H4. search.
</pre>

The structure of the proof is similar to <code>append_det</code>.
Again, the key to this proof is how case analysis works. For case
analysis of an object-level assumption to succeed, Abella requires
that, for any program clause,

<ul>
  <li> either none of its type instances are unifiable with the
   assumption, </li>
  <li> or there is a unique instance of it that is unifiable with the
    assumption in a type-generic way and that is obtained by
    instantiating its free type variables with type expressions
    constructed using only the type variables parameterizing the
    theorem being proved.
  </li>
</ul>

The second condition implies that

<ul>
  <li> a unique instance of the program clause is used for
  type-generic case analysis, </li>
  <li> all the other instances are irrelevant, </li>
  <li> and no new type variables are introduced by case analysis. </li>
</ul>

From these implications, we can see that the set of parameterizing
type variables are fixed and used as black boxes in case analysis. As
a result, case analysis is schematic with respect to the
parameterizing type variables.
</p>

<p>
To see an example when the above requirement is not satisfied,
consider the following &lambda;-Prolog program

<pre>
kind i     type.
type cst   A -> i.
type pred  i -> o.

pred (cst X).
</pre>

In the clause for <code>cst</code> is used at its most general
type. Thus, this clause has a free type variable which is also the
type of <code>X</code>.
</p>

<p>
If we try to prove the following theorem using the given proof script:

<pre>
Theorem ty_not_fdet_left : forall M,
  {pred M} -> false.
intros. case H1.
</pre>

We get stuck at the following proof state with an error message:
<pre>
Error: Cannot fully infer the type of the program clause: 
  pred (cst X) :- 

Variables: M
H1 : {pred M}
============================
 false
</pre>
The error message indicates that the type variable in <code>pred (cst
X)</code> is not fully fixed, because when unifying <code>M</code>
(which is of type <code>i</code>) with <code>cst X</code> we cannot
uniquely determine the type of <code>X</code>. As a result, there are
an infinite number of instances of <code>pred (cst X)</code> unifiable
with <code>{pred M}</code>, violating the aforementioned requirement.
</p>

<p>
Backchaining on a program clause has a similar requirement. For
example, we cannot prove the following theorem by
using <code>search</code> because from the type of <code>M</code> we
cannot fix the type of <code>X</code> in <code>pred (cst X)</code>.
<pre>
Theorem ty_not_fdet_right : forall M,
  {pred M}.
search.
</pre>
</p>
