    <p>
      This page contains the formalization of <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=237791">typed closure conversion</a>
      (TCC) for simply-typed lambda calculus (STLC) and 
      its properties in <a href="http://abella-prover.org">Abella</a>.  
      TCC is encoded by using the higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS).
      The source language and target language are both encoded in the HOAS style.  
      Two major properties of TCC are formalized in Abella:
    </p>

    <ul> 
      <li>
         TCC preserves types. The term output by TCC has the same type as the input term.
         The formalization is <a href="type-pres/cc.html">here</a>.
      </li>
      <br/>

      <li>
         TCC preserves meaning. The term output by TCC simulates the input term under evaluation.
         The simulation is defined as logical relations between source and target terms. The proof is
         based on the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/papers/closures/tr.pdf">"Typed Closure Conversion"</a>
         technical report by Y. Minamide, et al. The formalization is <a href="eval-pres/cc.html">here</a>.

         <br/><br/>
         In the previous proof, the simulation relation assumes termination of evaluations for the source and
         target language. However, the termination property might not hold for languages richer than STLC. For this,
         the meaning preservation is proved by using an alternative definition of simulation that does not assume termination.
         The formalization is <a href="eval-pres/cc_alt_sim.html">here</a>.
      </li>
    <ul>
