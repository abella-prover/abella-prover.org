  Bisimulation up-to techniques in Abella

<p>NOTE: this page is currently being developed.  It should be ready in a few more days.  (17 Oct 2013).</p>
<br/>

<p>
This webpage contains some supporting material for the paper: </p>
<center>
<a href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Dale.Miller/papers/upto-draft.pdf"><em>Formalization of the Bisimulation-Up-To Technique and its Meta Theory</em></a>. Kaustuv Chaudhuri, Matteo Cimini, and Dale Miller,
</center>
<br/>
<p>
which was submitted to <a href="http://www.etaps.org/index.php/2014/fossacs">FoSSaCS 2014</a>.
</p>

<p>
The formal specifications in this paper are written with a slight
extension to Abella where some higher-order quantification is allowed.
While our use of such higher-order quantification could easily be
replaced with only first-order quantification, the readability of the
specifications would be decreased.  In order to get Abella to treat
this particular notion of higher-order quantification in coinductive
proofs, the <tt>lax_coinduction</tt> branch of Abella is needed (for
more information,
see <a href="https://github.com/abella-prover/abella/issues/20">this</a>).
This is available on <a href="http:github.com">github</a> as the
following <a href="https://github.com/abella-prover/abella/archive/lax_coinduction.zip">zip
file</a>.

<h2>Complete formalizations</h2>

<ul class="navlist">
<li>
Up to techniques for CCS: <a href="ccs.thm">ccs.thm</a>. This file contains the specification of CCS, definition of various techniques: up-to bisimilarity, up-to transitivity, up-to
context, and up-to bisimularity and context. Also, the abstract definitions for soundness theorems and the soundness of those technique for bisimilarity for CCS. The files also contains several examples illustrating how to use these results.
</li>
<li>
Up to techniques for &pi;-calculus: <a href="pic.thm">pic.thm</a>. This file contains the specification of &pi;-calculus, definition of various techniques: up-to bisimilarity, up-to transitivity, up-to
context, and up-to bisimularity and context. Also, the abstract definitions for soundness theorems and the soundness of those technique for bisimilarity for CCS. The files also contains several examples illustrating how to use these results.
</li>
<li>
Up to techniques for weak bisimilarity, CCS: <a href="ccs_weak.thm">ccs_weak.thm</a> and &pi;-calculus: <a href="pic_weak.thm">pic_weak.thm</a>. <em>Important Disclaimer</em>: We have so far considered only the ordinary definition of weak bisimilarity (i.e. that basically plays strong bisimilarity on weak transitions.This definition does not pose problems with up-to techniques, and has a smooth theory of up-to techniques. However, this formulation is usually not useful in practice for proofs ([1], and corresponding references, to know more).
