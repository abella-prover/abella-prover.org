    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>
      Abella is an interactive theorem prover based on lambda-tree syntax. This means that Abella is well-suited for
      reasoning about the meta-theory of programming languages and other logical systems which manipulate objects with
      binding. For example, the following applications are included in the distribution of Abella.

    <p>
      Abella uses a <em>two-level logic</em> approach to reasoning. Specifications are made in the logic of hereditary
      Harrop formulas using lambda-tree syntax. This logic is executable and is a subset of the
      <a href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Dale.Miller/lProlog/">λProlog</a> language (see
      the <a href="http://teyjus.cs.umn.edu/">Teyjus</a> system for an implementation of this language). The reasoning
      logic of Abella is the culmination of a series of extensions to proof theory for the treatment of definitions,
      lambda-tree syntax, and generic judgments. The reasoning logic of Abella is able to encode the semantics of our
      specification logic as a definition and thereby reason over specifications in that logic. More information about
      this approach and the logics involved is available in the publications section.
    </p>

      Abella session which covers a proof of subject reduction in the lambda calculus.

          The original Abella system was designed and implemented
          by <a href="http://loonwerks.com/people/andrew-gacek.html">Andrew Gacek</a>, who also developed its logical
          foundations in collaboration with Dale Miller and Gopalan Nadathur.

        <li>
          The extension of Abella to include a richer specification logic starting from version 2.0.0 was carried out by
          <a href="http://www.cs.umn.edu/~yuting">Yuting Wang</a> (UMN) and <a href="http://chaudhuri.info">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a> (INRIA).

          A number of people have contributed to the design and the library of

      <h1>History</h1>

      <p>
        The Abella system represents a collaboration between a group at the <a href="http://www.cs.umn.edu">University
        of Minnesota</a> led by Gopalan Nadathur and the <a href="http://team.inria.fr/parsifal/">Parsifal</a> team at
        <a href="http://www.saclay.inria.fr">INRIA Saclay &ndash; Île-de-France</a>
        and <a href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr">LIX</a>/<a href="http://www.polytechnique.fr">Ecole
        Polytechnique</a> led by Dale Miller.

        Work on Abella began as part of an NSF-funded project at the University of Minnesota aimed at developing
        flexible frameworks for specifying, prototyping and reasoning about computational processes. Gopalan Nadathur
        provided guidance in the design of that version of Abella and he and Dale Miller contributed to the specific
        logic that Abella is based on.

        The recent extension of Abella to support a richer specification logic has been the result of a transatlantic
        collaboration supported by the <a href="http://chaudhuri.info/rapt/"><em>Recent Advances in Proof Theory</em></a>
        (RAPT) Associated Team, led by Kaustuv Chaudhuri (INRIA, France); international participants of this team
        include a group at McGill University (Canada) led by Brigitte Pientka and a group at the University of Minnesota
        (USA) led by Gopalan Nadathur. Work on this extension at the University of Minnesota has been supported by the
        NSF under the grants CCF-0917140 and OISE-1045885. As a part of this effort, Yuting Wang designed and
        implemented the extension to higher-order hereditary Harrop formulas as the specification language.
	Subsequent work, carried out by Gopalan Nadathur and Yuting Wang and supported by the NSF Grant CCF-1617771, has
        resulted in the addition of a form of schematic polymorphism to Abella.

        The reasoning logic underlying Abella builds on the previous work of several people, most prominently Alwen Tiu,
        Dale Miller and Raymond McDowell. Work on Abella has benefited from several comments and encouragement provided
        by Alwen Tiu and David Baelde who have also been amongst the first users of the system. Todd Wilson has created
        several large developments in Abella and has incorporated its use into some of his graduate courses; his
        resulting feedback has been invaluable for increasing the usability and robustness of the system.

      <h1>Funding</h1>

      <p>
        Work on Abella was funded in its early stages by a grant from Boston Scientific. Subsequent funding has been
        provided by the National Science Foundation through the Grants CCR-0429572, CCF-0917140, OISE-1045885, and CCF-1617771. The
        first two NSF grants also included supplementary funding from the OISE for Slimmer, an international
        collaborative project between the University of Minnesota and the Parsifal group at Ecole Polytechnique and
        INRIA, France. Support for the French portion of this collaboration has been provided by a sequence
        of <em>Associated Team</em> grants from INRIA.
