<div class="section">
<h2>Version 2.0.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>The specification language now supports full higher-order
Hereditary Harrop formulas.
</li>
<li> 
Added <a href="examples/index.html#higher-order">new examples</a>
for reasoning about higher-order specifications. Updated the existing examples to the new version.
</li>
<li>
Old proof scripts that involve reasoning over non-empty contexts are
broken. A guide for updating your old scripts is given <a href="updating_scripts.html">here</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.3.5</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>apply</code> and <code>backchain</code> tactics now
  produce witnesses when the witnesses option is enabled.</li>
<li>The <code>unfold</code> tactic applied using a definition with
  nabla in the head will now use "dummy nominals" in case the nabla
  bound variables are not used.</li>
<li><code>/</code> can no longer begin a name.</li>
<li>Underscore can now be used to represent anonymous variables in
  &lambda;Prolog specifications.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug when using <code>apply</code> with no arguments.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the normalization of binder names</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.3.4</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added <a href="reference-guide.html#subordination">subordination
  and the Close command</a>. This makes many pruning lemmas
  unnecessary, such as showing that a term of type <code>tm</code>
  cannot appear inside a term of type <code>nat</code>.</li>
<li>Added case analysis on flex-rigid equalities. For example, one can
  perform case analysis on an equality like <code>R N = plus A
  B</code>. The result is that one step of Huet's algorithm is
  performed (computing the possible imitation and projections) and
  for each result the standard pattern unification code is
  called.</li>
<li>Fixed a unification issue involving the occurs check.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.3.3</h2>
<ul>
<li>Optimized the handling of state information. Based on the
  developments included in the distribution, Version 1.3.3 is 150%
  faster than Version 1.3.2.</li>
<li>Added <a href="examples/programming-languages/ees.html">evaluation
    by explicit substitution</a> development contributed by J. Todd
    Wilson.</li>
<li>Added <a href="reference-guide.html#show">Show</a> command to
  display previously proved theorems.</li>
<li>Added <a href="reference-guide.html#split">Split</a> command to
  easily separate mutually inductive theorems.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with subgoal numbering.</li>
<li>The <code>apply</code> tactic no longer requires "dummy nominals"
  when nabla bound variables in a lemma are not used.</li>
<li>The <code>search</code> tactic now backtracks over equalities.</li>
<li>The <code>search</code> tactic now properly considers all nominal
  constants when trying to instantiate an existential.</li>
<li>The <code>cut</code> tactic can now be used without a
  '<code>with</code>' argument in which case the <code>search</code>
  tactic is used to find possible hypotheses to cut from a
  specification judgment.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.3.2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added <a href="reference-guide.html#specification-modularity">
  specification modularity</a> via <code>accum_sig</code>
  and <code>accumulate</code>.
</li>
<li>Loosened the <a href="reference-guide.html#compilation">
  conditions on importing developments</a> to allow greater use of
  specification modularity.
</li>
<li>Reorganized the examples directory to have a hierarchical
  structure.
</li>
<li>Added the <code>-M</code> flag which can be used to generate
  makefile style dependency lists for developments. Also
  added <code>examples/makefile</code> which demonstrates a typical
  makefile for a development.
</li>
<li>The <code>search</code> tactic now descends underneath forall and
  implication. It now embodies every right rule of the logic.
</li>
<li>A 'witnesses' option has been added to
  the <a href="reference-guide.html#set">Set command</a> which
  causes <em>search witnesses</em> to be displayed after successful uses
  of the <code>search</code> tactic.
</li>
<li>A warning is now issued when Teyjus keywords (which are not used
  in Abella) are used in a specification. In all other respects,
  specifications in Abella should now be a proper subset of those in
  Teyjus.
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.3.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a variable capture bug when using <code>apply</code>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.3</h2>
<br>
This version of Abella introduces simple-typing. Documentation is
available in the <a href="reference-guide.html#typing">reference guide
section on typing</a>.

<ul>
<li>The syntax of definitions has been changed so that all clauses are
  listed in a single command.
</li>
<li>Added the <code>backchain</code> tactic which is in some sense
  dual to the <code>apply</code> tactic. The <code>backchain</code>
  tactic applies a lemma (or hypothesis) to the current goal and
  produces new subgoals for each of the hypotheses to the lemma.
</li>
<li>Added the <code>permute</code> tactic which permutes the nominal
  constants in a hypothesis or goal.</li>
<li>Improved the handling of non-L&lambda; unification and
  constraints. After case analysis, lingering constraints are added as
  equality hypotheses.</li>
<li>Added <code>Quit</code> command.</li>
<li>Added <a href="examples/process-calculi/pi-calculus/">a
    development of some meta-theory of the &pi;-calculus</a>
    contributed by Dale Miller.</li>
<li>Added <a href="examples/misc/higher-order.html">a
    development which showcases some of the higher-order logic
    programming features which are available in Abella's specification
    logic</a>.
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.2</h2>
<br>
This version of Abella is aimed at supporting larger developments.
Most notably, it introduces a way to compile and import developments.
This requires a change to way specifications are associated with
developments which is not backwards compatible.

<ul>
<li>
  Specifications are now explicitly loaded into a development via
  the <code>Specification</code> command as
  described <a href="reference-guide.html#specification">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
  Developments may now be compiled and imported into other
  developments as
  described <a href="reference-guide.html#compilation">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
  The <code>Query</code> command allows the animation of definitions
  as described <a href="reference-guide.html#query">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
  Command line options have been reorganized. Run <code>abella
    --help</code> to find out more.
</li>
<li>
  Some run-time options may be configured via the
  <code>Set</code> command as described
  <a href="reference-guide.html#set">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
  Subgoals now use hierarchical numbering.
</li>
<li>
  Large hypotheses may now be abbreviated using
  the <code>abbrev</code> and <code>unabbrev</code> commands as
  described <a href="reference-guide.html#abbrev">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
  Multi-line comments are now supported via <code>/*</code>
  ... <code>*/</code>. These comments may be nested.
</li>
<li>
  The annotations for co-induction now use # and + to avoid confusion
  with the annotations for induction (@ and *).
</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.1.3</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>split</code> tactic now operates on n-ary
  conjunctions</li>
<li>Tactic names no longer conflict with terms during parsing</li>
<li>Added the <a href="reference-guide.html#specification-tactics">monotone
  tactic</a> which explicitly realizes the monotonicity property of
  specification logic contexts</li>
<li>Fixed a couple unification bugs</li>
<li>New examples
  <ul>
  <li><a href="examples/lambda-calculus/term-structure/path.html">
     path - equivalence of lambda terms based on the paths through
     terms</a></li>
  <li><a href="examples/logic/cut.html"> cut - this cut admissibility
     example has been updated to include all operators of the sequent
     calculus</a></li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.1.2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added <a href="examples/lambda-calculus/normalization/stlc-strong-norm.html">
    Girard's proof of strong normalization of the simply-typed
    lambda-calculus</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.1.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Abella now
  support <a href="reference-guide.html#mutual-induction">mutual
  induction</a> over specification judgments</li>
<li>Abella will now issue a warning if a definition might not be
  stratified</li>
<li>Better handling of specification contexts when
  using <code>apply</code></li>
<li>The <code>search</code> tactic now takes an optional natural
  number argument specifying the maximum depth of searching (default
  5)</li>
<li>New examples
  <ul>
  <li><a href="examples/lambda-calculus/term-structure/debruijn.html">
     debruijn - translation between higher-order and debruijn lambda
     terms</a></li>
  <li><a href="examples/logic/focus.html"> focus - soundness and
     completeness for a focused logic</a></li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added coinductive definitions and coinduction. These are used
  through the top-level command <code>CoDefine</code>, which works much
  like <code>Define</code>, and the tactic <code>coinduction</code>,
  which is similar to <code>induction</code> but takes no arguments. A
  brief example of these features is discussed in the Abella reference
  guide in the section on
  <a href="reference-guide.html#corestrictions">coinductive
  restrictions</a>. The following examples are now included in the
  distribution of Abella.
  <ul>
    <li><a href="examples/process-calculi/ccs.html"> ccs - results on
        the calculus of communicating systems</a></li>
    <li><a href="examples/misc/colist.html"> colist - results on
        (potentially) infinite lists</a></li>
    <li><a href="examples/misc/conat.html"> conat - results on the
        natural numbers with infinity</a></li>
  </ul>
  <b>Note:</b> The formal meta-logic underlying Abella with
  coinduction is still being developed. A paper with the full logic is
  forthcoming.
</li>

<li>Definitions now support an arbitrary number of nablas in the
head.</li>

<li>The example <a href="examples/misc/copy.html">copy</a> has been
updated to show the equivalence of single and double variable
definitions of a copy predicate.

<li>Added <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> tactics for
  selecting the left or right side when the current goal is a
  disjunction.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug when case-analysis on a definition with nabla in the
head was used multiple times.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug in the <code>exists</code> tactic where nominal
  constants were being treated as regular constants.</li>

<li>Changed the emacs highlighting for Abella. The goal is to
highlight the theorems and definitions in a file while downplaying the
tactics. Hopefully this makes it easier to skim a file.</li>

<li>Added more checks to definitions such as preventing the use of
undefined predicates and requiring all clauses for a particular
predicate to occur together.</li>

<li>Removed the <code>Axiom</code> command since it can be replaced with a
theorem which uses only the <code>skip</code> tactic.
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.0.2</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>search</code> tactic now does a better job of
  backtracking. In particular, each instantiatable variable is now
  unbound when the event which caused it to be bound is backtracked
  over.</li>
<li>The <code>search</code> tactic now delays conflict pairs which
  fall outside of the pattern unification fragment. Thus this tactic
  is now more robust.</li>
<li>The <code>apply</code> tactic now allows specific instantiations
  for variables. The general form is
  <blockquote>
    <code>apply &lt;HYP-NAME&gt; to &lt;HYP-NAMES&gt; with X1 = T1,
    ..., Xn = Tn.</code>
  </blockquote>
  where the <code>X1</code> ... <code>Xn</code> are the variables to
  be instantiated with <code>T1</code> ... <code>Tn</code>.
</li>
<li>Randy Pollack has contributed a formalization of
  the <a href="examples/lambda-calculus/cr.html">Church-Rosser
  theorem</a> using Takahashi's proof based on complete
  developments.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.0.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Slightly extended the ability of the <code>search</code> tactic by
  adding some corner cases of unification.</li>
<li>Added definedness and arity checks on the usages of
  definitions</li>
<li>The <code>search</code> tactic now uses iterative deepening
  depth-first search instead of simply depth-first search.</li>
<li>Fixed some font-locking issues in the emacs files.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>First public release of Abella</li>
