<div class="section">
<h2>Version 2.0.5</h2>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Added support for (first-order) polymorphic definitions. Definitions such as the following are now accepted.</p>
<pre><code>  Define fresh : A -&gt; B -&gt; prop by
    nabla x, fresh x M.</code></pre>
<p>In every use of the definition, the type arguments are implicitly instantiated. The type-checking <em>for</em> such definitions is identical to taking all the unbound variable names and quantifying them on the outside. In other words, for the above definition, the behavior of type
-checking is the same as if there were:</p>
<pre><code>  Kind A,B  type
  Define fresh : A -&gt; B -&gt; prop by
    nabla x, fresh x M.</code></pre>
<p>Once such a definition is type-checked, the defined symbols are added to the signature as new polymorphic constants, in a vein similar to the <code>pi</code> constant. Whenever it is used, the type arguments are implicitly instantiated based on the types of the arguments.</p></li>

<li><p>Added support for (first-order) polymorphic theorems. A theorem such as the following is now accepted.</p>
<pre><code>  Theorem prune[A] : forall E L, nabla (x:A), member (E x) L -&gt;
     exists F, E = x\ F.</code></pre>
<p>The <code>A</code> here is a type parameter, which must be distinct from the other basic types in scope. To use such a theorem, you <em>must</em> supply enough arguments. An example:</p>
<pre><code>  Theorem bar : forall E G, nabla (x:tm) (y:ty),
     member (E x y) G -&gt; exists F, E = x\ y\ F.
  intros.
  apply prune[tm] to H1.
  apply prune[ty] to H1.
  search.</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>Tweaks to existing functionality</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The syntax for quantifiers now allows for multiple bound variables of the same type. Example:</p>
<pre><code>  /* Type p i -&gt; i -&gt; prop. */
  forall (x y : i) (f g : i -&gt; i), p (f (g y)) (g (f x))</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The <code>apply</code> tactic now takes an optional numerical argument that defines the search depth for automatic searches performed for omitted arguments. A bound of 0 means that no searches are attempted.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>abbrev</code> and <code>unabbrev</code> tactics now both take a list of hypotheses to (un)abbreviate. The display of abbreviations has also been compressed.</p></li>
<li><p>Error messages in interactive mode are printed to stderr in addition to any other output file specified with <code>-o</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>monotone</code> tactic now accepts hypothesis naming hints. (#91)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bugfixes</p>
<ul>
<li>Query was broken since 2.0.4-beta2.<br />
(#69; reported by Ahn Ki Yung)</li>
<li>Backchain now correctly takes into account inductive restrictions<br />
(#70; reported by Ahn Ki Yung)</li>
<li>Search now correctly raises eigenvariables over support<br />
(#71; reported by Morten Rhiger)</li>
<li>Undo/ProofGeneral now handles <code>abbrev</code> and <code>unabbrev</code> correctly.</li>
<li>Do not normalize object sequents except when they occur shallowly among the assumptions or goal. Deep normalization is unsound.<br />
(Reported by Dale Miller)</li>
<li>The <code>apply</code> tactic was invalidly raising guessed instances over nominal constants that already occur in the body of the lemma.<br />
(#96; reported by Ahn Ki Yung and Alwen Tiu)</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 2.0.4</h2>

<p>Possibly breaking changes</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>search</code> tactic has the same error handling behavior in interactive and non-interactive modes, functioning like a failed tactic in both cases if no subgoals were closed.</li>
<li>The character <code>&amp;</code> can no longer appear inside the names of identifiers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Added support for specification-level conjunction, written using <code>&amp;</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a new tactic form:</p>
<pre><code>search with &lt;witness&gt;.</code></pre>
<p>This tactic runs the search command with a given search witness. To see these witnesses, run any of the other search forms with:</p>
<pre><code>Set witnesses on.</code></pre>
<p>The witness string that is printed can then be used to replay the exact same search. There is no backtracking involved with witness strings. Hence, the replay will tend to be a lot faster.</p>
<p>Witnesses have the following grammar:</p>
<pre><code>witness ::= true | =
          | left witness | right witness
          | split(witness,witness)
          | apply hyp
          | intros[id1, ..., idn] witness
          | exists[id1=term1, ..., idn=termn] witness
          | unfold(id,n,witness1,...,witnessn)
          | (witness)
          | *</code></pre>
<p>The last witness form stands for a place-holder so you can give partial witnesses to search. In fact, the default search tactic is identical to:</p>
<pre><code>search with *.</code></pre>
<p>Please use this feature sparingly, and only when building proofs. After you are done with the proof, delete the &quot;with&quot; statements. These witnesses will NOT be portable across different versions of Abella, as they are very particular to the &quot;search&quot; tactic implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a new tactic form for <code>backchain</code> and `assert:</p>
<pre><code>backchain &lt;num&gt; &lt;hyp_or_lemma&gt;.
assert &lt;num&gt; &lt;formula&gt;.</code></pre>
<p>where the <code>&lt;num&gt;</code>, which is optional, can give a depth bound to the search that is automatically attempted on generated goals. Give it a depth of 0 if you want to prevent searching. The default value is the value of the search_depth flag.</p></li>
<li>Added a new command line flag <code>-f</code> that takes a comma-separated list of key=value pairs and initializes the flags based on them. For flags that can be set to <code>on</code>/<code>off</code>, you can just use the key and it means to set them to <code>on</code>. For example, <code>-f subgoals=off,witnesses</code> sets <code>subgoals</code> to <code>off</code> and <code>witnesses</code> to <code>on</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tweaks to existing functionality</p>
<ul>
<li>Import declarations automatically compile if needed. An explicit Makefile is very rarely needed any more.</li>
<li>The <code>exists</code> and <code>witness</code> tactics now take a comma-separated list of existential witnesses. Each witness can also be of the form <code>&lt;id&gt; = &lt;term&gt;</code> which selects a particular existential variable to instantiate. Without the <code>&lt;id&gt; =</code> part it always instantiates the first variables.</li>
<li>The <code>induction</code> tactic can now traverse an arbitrary sequence of <code>forall</code>, <code>nabla</code>, and <code>-&gt;</code> connectives when finding the induction argument.</li>
<li>The <code>search</code> tactic now does a small amount of asynchronous reasoning for newly created hypotheses (e.g., reducing pattern equations).</li>
</ul>

<p>Experimental changes (may be changed or removed in the future)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Added support for (first-order) polymorphic definitions. Definitions such as the following are now accepted.</p>
<pre><code>Define fresh : A -&gt; B -&gt; prop by
  nabla x, fresh x M.</code></pre>
<p>In every use of the definition, the type arguments are implicitly instantiated. The type-checking <em>for</em> such definitions is identical to taking all the unbound variable names and quantifying them on the outside. In other words, for the above definition, the behavior of type-checking is the same as if there were:</p>
<pre><code>    Kind A,B  type
    Define fresh : A -&gt; B -&gt; prop by
      nabla x, fresh x M.</code></pre>
<p>Once such a definition is type-checked, the defined symbols are added to the signature as new polymorphic constants, in a vein similar to the <code>pi</code> constant. Whenever it is used, the type arguments are implicitly instantiated based on the types of the arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for (first-order) polymorphic theorems. A theorem such as the following is now accepted.</p>
<pre><code>Theorem prune_arg[A] : forall E L, nabla (x:A), member (E x) L -&gt;
   exists F, E = x\ F.</code></pre>
<p>The <code>A</code> here is a type parameter, which must be distinct from the other basic types in scope. To use such a theorem, you <em>must</em> supply enough arguments. An example:</p>
<pre><code>    Theorem bar : forall E G, nabla (x:tm) (y:ty),
       member (E x y) G -&gt; exists F, E = x\ y\ F.
    intros.
    apply prune_arg[tm] to H1.
    apply prune_arg[ty] to H1.
    search.</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Added limited support for predicate instantiation during import. The form</p>
<pre><code>Import &quot;thmfile&quot; with id1 := defid1, ..., idn := defidn.</code></pre>
<p>performs an import as usual, but any undefined predicates id in &quot;thmfile&quot; are instantiated with defined predicates defid. An undefined predicate is declared as usual with:</p>
<pre><code>    Type id  T1 -&gt; T2 -&gt; ... -&gt; Tn -&gt; prop.</code></pre>
<p>It remains illegal to import a thm with undefined predicates without giving the predicate instantiations.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a new &quot;extrusive&quot; tactic form <code>clear -&gt;</code> that can be used to do the opposite of the <code>intros</code> tactic, i.e., <code>intros H1 ... Hn</code> is opposite to <code>clear -&gt; Hn ... H1</code>. Variables can also be extruded in this form and they universally close the goal with respect to the variable if the variable is not free in any hypothesis.</p></li>
<li><p>Extended the <code>subgoals</code> flag to take a <em>subgoal specification string</em> argument that can be used to fine tune the subgoals to display. As an example, the invocation:</p>
<pre><code>Set subgoals &quot;0[0];1[2];2[3];3;4[10]&quot;.</code></pre>
<p>instructs Abella to show 0 additinoal subgoals at depth 0, max 2 additional subgoals at 1, max 3 additional subgoals at depth 2, all subgoals at depth 3, and max 10 subgoals at depth 4. The depths need not be given in order, and any omitted depths display the default number of subgoals. The default flags <code>on</code>, <code>off</code>, and an <em>unquoted</em> number have the following meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>on</code> : the same as <code>&quot;0[∞];1[∞];…&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>off</code> : the same as <code>&quot;0[0];1[0];…&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>n</code> : the same as <code>&quot;0[0];̣…;n-1[0];n[∞];n+1[0];…&quot;</code></li></ul>
</ul>

<p>Bugfixes</p>
<ul>
<li>Annotation mode (-a) output is no longer printed in other modes</li>
<li>Import statements can now be undone as well from ProofGeneral</li>
<li>Importing .thcs made with a different Abella binary will now print an error message instead of causing a segmentation fault (#39)</li>
<li>Importing from different directories now works correctly</li>
<li>Multiple occurrences of a single variable in a binding list is now correctly rejected. (#56)</li>
<li>Better error messages. (#64)</li>
</ul>

<li>Bisimulations relating the π-calculus and the λ-calculus (contributed by Horace Blanc and Beniamino Accattoli)</li>
<li>Type-preservation of Curry-style System F (contributed by Ahn Ki Yung)</li>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 2.0.3</h2>

<p>Potentially breaking changes</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed <code>~</code> and <code>!=</code> notations (undocumented introduction in 2.0.2). A general notation support may be considered for Abella in the future. Meanwhile, we prefer simplicity and predictability.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
<li>The unfold tactic has an optional argument, &quot;(all)&quot;, that produces a disjunction of all solutions to the matching problem of the conclusion of a subgoal and its relevant (co)definition. The disjuncts are produced in the same order as the clauses, but if a single clause has multiple ways to match the head then the disjuncts for that clause are in some unspecified order (that depends on the details of the unification algorithm).</li>
<li><p>The following tactic forms have been added:</p>
<pre><code>apply *H to ...
apply ... to ... *H ...
backchain *H
cut *H ...
cut ... with *H
inst *H with ...
monotone *H with ...</code></pre>
<p>In each case, if H names a hypothesis, then the tactic consumes the hypothesis (like the clear tactic). Note that if hypothesis hints are given, then these hints are used <em>after</em> consuming the hypotheses. Thus, if one writes:</p>
<pre><code>  foo : apply lem to *foo bar baz.</code></pre>
<p>then the hypothesis named foo is effectively <em>replaced</em> with a new hypothesis named foo that is the result of applying the lem to the old foo and the other arguments.</p></li>
<li>Optional semi-colon allowed before the first clause in a definition or co-definition block.</li>
<li>Variable renaming can overwrite old variables that have already been instantiated.</li>
<li>The <code>clear</code> tactic can also remove instantiated variables.</li>
<li>The settable option &quot;types&quot; displays the types of variables in subgoals</li>
</ul>

<p>Internal changes</p>
<ul>
<li>The parser has stronger checks to enforce the lexical convention that all identifiers matching n[0-9]+ are nominal constants.</li>
<li>Most user-visible error messages have been made a bit more precise and informative.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bugfixes</p>
<ul>
<li>Abella now builds on versions of OCaml between 3.12.1 and 4.01.0 (inclusive) again.</li>
<li>Unfolding named clauses now raises clauses over the support of the goal and existentially closes over residual logic variables (soundness bug introduced in 2.0.2) (#33)</li>
<li>Unfolding named clauses whose heads do not unify with goal now causes failure instead of success. (soundness bug introduced in 2.0.2)</li>
<li>Web-page generating scripts properly handle proof syntax changes since version 1.3.5.</li>
<li>The toplevel now prints tactics using the same syntax as in proof scripts.</li>
<li>The apply tactic can now apply lemmas that do not have a forall prefix.</li>
<li>In the Query command, fresh logic variables are allocated to be independent of existing capitalized identifiers in the query. This prevents the generated solutions from appearing to be non-idempotent.</li>
</ul>

<p>New examples</p>
<ul>
<li>The process calculus examples have been re-organized. There are now two medium sized new developments of the meta-theory of bisimulation-up-to techniques for CCS and the pi-calculus.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 2.0.2</h2>

<p>Potentially breaking changes.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Constants with names matching n[0-9]+ are forcibly treated as
 nominal constants. This fixes an unsoundness due to ambiguous
 parsing of such constants in proofs.</li>
 <li>The tactic <code>exists</code> now has a synonym: <code>witness</code>. This adds
 <code>witness</code> to the list of keywords.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
 <li>Specification language now supports <code>&lt;=</code> in addition to <code>=&gt;</code></li>
 <li>Binders are printed using variable naming hints from the
 source instead of in a normalized form (x1, x2, etc.)</li>
 <li>Can unfold the nth clause of an inductive or co-inductive
 definition block using <code>unfold n</code>.</li>
 <li>Can name clauses in the specification (in .mod files) using a
 comment of the form <code>%:nm:</code> on a line by itself right
 before the clause. There must be a single Abella identifier and no
 spaces between the two :s.</li>
 <li>Can unfold a specific clause named <code>nm</code> of a specification using
 <code>unfold nm</code>.</li>
 <li>New flag &quot;instantiations&quot; shows variable instantiations at the top
 of a subgoal.</li>
 <li>New notation <code>~ F</code> for <code>F -&gt; false</code>.</li>
 <li>The backchain tactic now allows backchaining formulas that are
 not prenex-quantified implications. The &quot;head&quot; of the backchained
 formula is interpreted as any formula that is not an implication.</li>
 <li>The rename tactic has been extended to also allow renaming
 variables, with an identical syntax.</li>
</ul>

<p>Internal changes</p>
<ul>
 <li>Terms and meta-terms now have pretty-printer with a plugin
 architecture for future extensions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bug fixes</p>
<ul>
 <li>The exists/witness tactics now rename to avoid capture (#22)</li>
 <li>Raising over nominal constants in spec. sequents raises over the
 support of the whole sequent rather than just its conclusion.</li>
 <li>Normalizing of binders now avoid capture (#23)</li>
 <li>Instantiated variables are no longer printed in the variables list
 of a sequent.</li>
 <li>Higher-order definitions have a stricter stratification check that
 complains both about actual and potential unsound definitions.</li>
 <li>The subordination checker now does not complain about invalid
 subterms for types that have not been explicitly Closed.</li>
 <li>The rename tactic cannot rename lemmas (i.e., theorems proved
 earlier)</li>
</ul>

<p>New examples</p>
<ul>
 <li>Formalization of the meta-theory of higher-order HH using only the
 reasoning logic of Abella (<a href='/examples/logic/hh_meta.html'>examples/logic/hh_meta.thm</a>).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 2.0.1</h2>
<p>This is a minor bugfix release for 2.0.0</p>
<ul>
<li>Restored a number of missing commits that were lost during the branch merge for 2.0.0.</li>
<li>URLs in the examples and documentation updated to <a href="http://abella-prover.org">abella-prover.org</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed code to generate <code>src/version.ml</code></li>
<li>A number of minor internal tweaks.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 2.0.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>The specification language now supports full higher-order
Hereditary Harrop formulas.
</li>
<li> 
Added <a href="examples/index.html#higher-order">new examples</a>
for reasoning about higher-order specifications. Updated the existing examples to the new version.
</li>
<li>
Old proof scripts that involve reasoning over non-empty contexts are
broken. A guide for updating your old scripts is given <a href="updating_scripts.html">here</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.3.5</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>apply</code> and <code>backchain</code> tactics now
  produce witnesses when the witnesses option is enabled.</li>
<li>The <code>unfold</code> tactic applied using a definition with
  nabla in the head will now use "dummy nominals" in case the nabla
  bound variables are not used.</li>
<li><code>/</code> can no longer begin a name.</li>
<li>Underscore can now be used to represent anonymous variables in
  &lambda;Prolog specifications.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug when using <code>apply</code> with no arguments.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the normalization of binder names</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.3.4</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added <a href="reference-guide.html#subordination">subordination
  and the Close command</a>. This makes many pruning lemmas
  unnecessary, such as showing that a term of type <code>tm</code>
  cannot appear inside a term of type <code>nat</code>.</li>
<li>Added case analysis on flex-rigid equalities. For example, one can
  perform case analysis on an equality like <code>R N = plus A
  B</code>. The result is that one step of Huet's algorithm is
  performed (computing the possible imitation and projections) and
  for each result the standard pattern unification code is
  called.</li>
<li>Fixed a unification issue involving the occurs check.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.3.3</h2>
<ul>
<li>Optimized the handling of state information. Based on the
  developments included in the distribution, Version 1.3.3 is 150%
  faster than Version 1.3.2.</li>
<li>Added <a href="examples/programming-languages/ees.html">evaluation
    by explicit substitution</a> development contributed by J. Todd
    Wilson.</li>
<li>Added <a href="reference-guide.html#show">Show</a> command to
  display previously proved theorems.</li>
<li>Added <a href="reference-guide.html#split">Split</a> command to
  easily separate mutually inductive theorems.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with subgoal numbering.</li>
<li>The <code>apply</code> tactic no longer requires "dummy nominals"
  when nabla bound variables in a lemma are not used.</li>
<li>The <code>search</code> tactic now backtracks over equalities.</li>
<li>The <code>search</code> tactic now properly considers all nominal
  constants when trying to instantiate an existential.</li>
<li>The <code>cut</code> tactic can now be used without a
  '<code>with</code>' argument in which case the <code>search</code>
  tactic is used to find possible hypotheses to cut from a
  specification judgment.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.3.2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added <a href="reference-guide.html#specification-modularity">
  specification modularity</a> via <code>accum_sig</code>
  and <code>accumulate</code>.
</li>
<li>Loosened the <a href="reference-guide.html#compilation">
  conditions on importing developments</a> to allow greater use of
  specification modularity.
</li>
<li>Reorganized the examples directory to have a hierarchical
  structure.
</li>
<li>Added the <code>-M</code> flag which can be used to generate
  makefile style dependency lists for developments. Also
  added <code>examples/makefile</code> which demonstrates a typical
  makefile for a development.
</li>
<li>The <code>search</code> tactic now descends underneath forall and
  implication. It now embodies every right rule of the logic.
</li>
<li>A 'witnesses' option has been added to
  the <a href="reference-guide.html#set">Set command</a> which
  causes <em>search witnesses</em> to be displayed after successful uses
  of the <code>search</code> tactic.
</li>
<li>A warning is now issued when Teyjus keywords (which are not used
  in Abella) are used in a specification. In all other respects,
  specifications in Abella should now be a proper subset of those in
  Teyjus.
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.3.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a variable capture bug when using <code>apply</code>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.3</h2>
<br>
This version of Abella introduces simple-typing. Documentation is
available in the <a href="reference-guide.html#typing">reference guide
section on typing</a>.

<ul>
<li>The syntax of definitions has been changed so that all clauses are
  listed in a single command.
</li>
<li>Added the <code>backchain</code> tactic which is in some sense
  dual to the <code>apply</code> tactic. The <code>backchain</code>
  tactic applies a lemma (or hypothesis) to the current goal and
  produces new subgoals for each of the hypotheses to the lemma.
</li>
<li>Added the <code>permute</code> tactic which permutes the nominal
  constants in a hypothesis or goal.</li>
<li>Improved the handling of non-L&lambda; unification and
  constraints. After case analysis, lingering constraints are added as
  equality hypotheses.</li>
<li>Added <code>Quit</code> command.</li>
<li>Added <a href="examples/process-calculi/pi-calculus/">a
    development of some meta-theory of the &pi;-calculus</a>
    contributed by Dale Miller.</li>
<li>Added <a href="examples/misc/higher-order.html">a
    development which showcases some of the higher-order logic
    programming features which are available in Abella's specification
    logic</a>.
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.2</h2>
<br>
This version of Abella is aimed at supporting larger developments.
Most notably, it introduces a way to compile and import developments.
This requires a change to way specifications are associated with
developments which is not backwards compatible.

<ul>
<li>
  Specifications are now explicitly loaded into a development via
  the <code>Specification</code> command as
  described <a href="reference-guide.html#specification">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
  Developments may now be compiled and imported into other
  developments as
  described <a href="reference-guide.html#compilation">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
  The <code>Query</code> command allows the animation of definitions
  as described <a href="reference-guide.html#query">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
  Command line options have been reorganized. Run <code>abella
    --help</code> to find out more.
</li>
<li>
  Some run-time options may be configured via the
  <code>Set</code> command as described
  <a href="reference-guide.html#set">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
  Subgoals now use hierarchical numbering.
</li>
<li>
  Large hypotheses may now be abbreviated using
  the <code>abbrev</code> and <code>unabbrev</code> commands as
  described <a href="reference-guide.html#abbrev">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
  Multi-line comments are now supported via <code>/*</code>
  ... <code>*/</code>. These comments may be nested.
</li>
<li>
  The annotations for co-induction now use # and + to avoid confusion
  with the annotations for induction (@ and *).
</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.1.3</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>split</code> tactic now operates on n-ary

<h2>Version 1.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added coinductive definitions and coinduction. These are used
  through the top-level command <code>CoDefine</code>, which works much
  like <code>Define</code>, and the tactic <code>coinduction</code>,
  which is similar to <code>induction</code> but takes no arguments. A
  brief example of these features is discussed in the Abella reference
  guide in the section on
  <a href="reference-guide.html#corestrictions">coinductive
  restrictions</a>. The following examples are now included in the
  distribution of Abella.
  <ul>
    <li><a href="examples/process-calculi/ccs.html"> ccs - results on
        the calculus of communicating systems</a></li>
    <li><a href="examples/misc/colist.html"> colist - results on
        (potentially) infinite lists</a></li>
    <li><a href="examples/misc/conat.html"> conat - results on the
        natural numbers with infinity</a></li>
  </ul>
  <b>Note:</b> The formal meta-logic underlying Abella with
  coinduction is still being developed. A paper with the full logic is
  forthcoming.
</li>

<li>Definitions now support an arbitrary number of nablas in the
head.</li>

<li>The example <a href="examples/misc/copy.html">copy</a> has been
updated to show the equivalence of single and double variable
definitions of a copy predicate.

<li>Added <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> tactics for
  selecting the left or right side when the current goal is a
  disjunction.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug when case-analysis on a definition with nabla in the
head was used multiple times.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug in the <code>exists</code> tactic where nominal
  constants were being treated as regular constants.</li>

<li>Changed the emacs highlighting for Abella. The goal is to
highlight the theorems and definitions in a file while downplaying the
tactics. Hopefully this makes it easier to skim a file.</li>

<li>Added more checks to definitions such as preventing the use of
undefined predicates and requiring all clauses for a particular
predicate to occur together.</li>

<li>Removed the <code>Axiom</code> command since it can be replaced with a
theorem which uses only the <code>skip</code> tactic.
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.0.2</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>search</code> tactic now does a better job of
  backtracking. In particular, each instantiatable variable is now
  unbound when the event which caused it to be bound is backtracked
  over.</li>
<li>The <code>search</code> tactic now delays conflict pairs which
  fall outside of the pattern unification fragment. Thus this tactic
  is now more robust.</li>
<li>The <code>apply</code> tactic now allows specific instantiations
  for variables. The general form is
  <blockquote>
    <code>apply &lt;HYP-NAME&gt; to &lt;HYP-NAMES&gt; with X1 = T1,
    ..., Xn = Tn.</code>
  </blockquote>
  where the <code>X1</code> ... <code>Xn</code> are the variables to
  be instantiated with <code>T1</code> ... <code>Tn</code>.
</li>
<li>Randy Pollack has contributed a formalization of
  the <a href="examples/lambda-calculus/cr.html">Church-Rosser
  theorem</a> using Takahashi's proof based on complete
  developments.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.0.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Slightly extended the ability of the <code>search</code> tactic by
  adding some corner cases of unification.</li>
<li>Added definedness and arity checks on the usages of
  definitions</li>
<li>The <code>search</code> tactic now uses iterative deepening
  depth-first search instead of simply depth-first search.</li>
<li>Fixed some font-locking issues in the emacs files.</li>
